# DATA SETS
PEMA_male_data.csv - male reproductive traits, body size, and associated climate variables used in the Ecosphere paper
PEMA_phenology_final_dataframe.csv - female reproductive traits, body size, and associated climate variables used in McLean and Guralnick (2021)

# R CODE
R code used in the male paper, largely hierarchical GAMs and generalized linear mixed models, model comparisons, and plotting functions
